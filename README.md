The algorithm was written in the open-source language Julia 1.6 using the Visual Studio code intergraded development environment. In addition, the following Julia packages were used: NetCDF v0.11.7; LsqFit v0.13.0; Interpolations v0.14.7; Statistics (part of Julia standard library); DataFrames v1.4.4; CSV v0.10.9; ProgressBars v1.4.1; SpecialFunctions v2.1.7;  Plots v1.38.3; StatsBase v0.33.21; JLD2 v0.4.30; Peaks v0.4.3; MAT v0.10.3; Distributions v0.25.80; Random (part of Julia standard library). Figure 3-8 were made using the Makie.jl V0.19.2 plotting frond-end and GLMakie.jl V0.8.2 backend. The functions that the algorithm comprises can be found in **Milani et al 2024.jl**.
